# Project assessing pain

## Techical task: 
  To develop an application for the automatic assessment of pain levels from video images of the face for further implementation in telemedicine systems. 
  
### Stages of development:
+ Find an appropriate dataset.
+ Investigate existing models that solve the problem of pain assessment using video images of faces.
+ Compare the results of the analyzed models on the selected dataset.
+ Select the model and develop a user interface suitable for implementation in telemedicine systems.

### The expected result:
  A script that takes video as input and outputs a person's estimated pain level based on the video.
